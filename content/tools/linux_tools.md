### Computer Aided INvestigative Environment (CAINE)

CAINE is a GNU/Linux based distribution used for forensic analysis. The distribution has a user-friendly graphical interface and aims at providing easy access to user-friendly tools needed in order to perform digital forensic analysis. The distribution is popular, as it can be easily used during all four stages of the digital forensic analysis process. CAINE is open-source and possess a software write blocker, which is helpful when trying to preserve the integrity of the forensic artefacts and the underlying system. CAINE features various tools inside the distribution such as:

### Guymager

Guymager is an open-source forensic imager. It provides a simple interface for creating forensic disk images or cloning disks with support for multiple file formats and is known for its reliability. Guymager works for Windows, macOS and Linux systems. Disk images created are either flat (dd), EWF (E01) and AFF images. The main advantage of Guymager is its speed, which is achieved by a multi-threaded and pipelined design and multi-threaded data compression.
