Thanks for stopping by! This is the Forensic Analysis Compendium, your go-to resource for navigating the digital forensics on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems.

## The Heart of the Matter

In our digital age, cyber threats are everywhere, and unfortunately, malware has become a common headache for many. Whether you're a professional in the field, a student, or just someone trying to secure their digital space, understanding how to respond to these threats is crucial. That’s where forensic analysis comes into play, and it’s exactly what this project focuses on.

## Why This Site Matters

Malware doesn’t play favorites; it targets Windows, macOS, and Linux systems alike. Despite this, finding clear, concise, and actionable information on how to deal with an attack can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack. Recognizing this gap, the Forensic Analysis Compendium was created to simplify the initial steps of forensic analysis, bringing together essential resources and guides under one roof.

## The Mission

The aim is to demystify the process of forensic analysis. This site is designed to be a starting point for anyone facing the aftermath of a malware attack, offering guidance on what data to look at first, which tools might help, and how to use them across different operating systems.

## Inside the Compendium

Here, you'll find everything you need to get a good first insight during your forensic analysis. You get a clear path to follow, ensuring you can approach the situation easily.

## What’s Next?

This project is just the beginning. The digital landscape and the threats within it are always evolving, and so will this compendium. The site is here to keep you updated, informed, and ready to tackle whatever comes your way.
