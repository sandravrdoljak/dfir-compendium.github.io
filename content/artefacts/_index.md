Welcome to the heart of our forensic toolkit.
I have pinpointed 25 crucial artifacts for forensic analysis across Windows, macOS, and Linux systems. This selection emerged from research, practical analysis and testing conducted during the thesis, aiming to highlight the artifacts that give the most significant insights for cybersecurity incidents.

I have chosen 15 for a thorough examination, with a special emphasis on 10 that provide quick and clear insights, allowing for an efficient start to any investigation. This dual approach ensures a easy start to forensic examinations, validated by hands-on testing in real-world scenarios.
